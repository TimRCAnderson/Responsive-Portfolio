			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr/>
			<img id="headshot" src="assets/images/TimothyRCAnderson_Logo.svg" alt="Picture of Timothy Anderson"/>
			<p>My name is Timothy Richard Clark Anderson. I have an Associates of Applied Sciences in Simulation and Game Development, and five years of experience working in a development environment. My development experience has included both Agile and Waterfall development workflows, and has often challenged me to learn new languages in order to accomplish my responsibilities.</p>
			<p>My free time has encompassed a number of different activities. When I was younger, I learned to sail in an optimist (a type of very small sailboat). I’ve always had a knack for technology, and I’m currently a member of Hackerspace Charlotte. I’ve also learned basic blacksmithing, and I’m learning to draft in CAD programs for 3D printing. From time to time, I try my hand at cosplay, and that is constantly teaching me new things.</p>
